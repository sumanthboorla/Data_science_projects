It is used to identify the strength of the relationship between the variables and to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n","\n","* **Polynomial regression:** This type of linear regression is used to model relationships between the dependent and independent variables that are not linear.

In Python, this can be performed using the sklearn library. To use multiple regression with this library, you will first need to create a LinearRegression object, then train the model on your data using the fit() method.
